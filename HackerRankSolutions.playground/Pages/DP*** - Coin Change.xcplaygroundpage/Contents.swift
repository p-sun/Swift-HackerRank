Given a target dollars amount, and a list of dollar values for distinct coins, print the number of ways you can make change for n dollars if each coin is available in an infinite quantity.
\
\
e.g. Given `coins: [1, 3]` and `target: 6`. There are 3 combinations: 1+1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+3, and 3+3.
\
\
Start with coins of value 1. There is one combintion to make each target value from 0...6.

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Now look at combinations using coins of value 1 and 3.
* No new combinations can be made with target i of 1...2.
* At target i = 3, combinations[3] = combinations[3] + combinations[0] = 1 + 1 = 2
* combinations[3] = 1 is "one combination of value 1 coins to make target 3". i.e. 1+1+1
* combinations[0] = 1 is "one combination of coins to make target 0". Thus, we can add a 'coin of value 3' to combinations[0] to make 1 new combination for combinations[3].


[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]

* At target i = 6, combinations[6] = combinations[6] + combinations[3] = 1 + 2 = 3.
* combinations[6] = 1 is "1 combination of value 1 coins to make target 3". i.e. 1+1+1+1+1+1
* combinations[3] = 2 is "2 combinations of value 1 & 3 coins to make target 3". i.e. 1+1+1 & 3
* Thus, we can add a 'coin of value 3' to each combination at combinations[3] to make 2 new combinations for target 6. i.e. 1+1+1+3 and 3+3.
