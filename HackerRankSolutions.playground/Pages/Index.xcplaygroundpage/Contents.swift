 ### Arrays
 
 [Two Ints that Add to Target](Array*%20-%20Two%20Ints%20that%20Add%20to%20Target) | Easy | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
 \
 Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a target.
 \
 i.e. Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, return [0, 1].

 [Max Product of Two Ints](Array**%20-%20Max%20Product%20of%20Two%20Ints) | Medium
 \
 Given an integer array, return the greatest product of any of the two numbers.

 [Max Sum of Two Ints](Array*%20-%20Max%20Sum%20of%20Two%20Ints) | Easy
 \
 Given an integer array, return the greatest SUM of any of the two numbers.

[Left Rotation](Array*%20-%20Left%20Rotation) | Easy | [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/problem) | CTCI🌟
 \
 Rotate an array by d positions to the left.

 [Making Anagrams](Array*%20-%20Making%20Anagrams) | Easy | [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-making-anagrams/problem) | CTCI🌟
 \
 Find the minimum number of character deletions required to make two strings anagrams of each other.
 i.e. Given "abc" and "uwbja", we need to delete 4 letters total so they'd become "ab" and "ba".
 
 ### Strings
 [Is Palindrome](Strings*%20-%20Is%20Palindrome) | Easy | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description)
 \
 Returns whether a String is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters

 [Cut Letters](Strings**%20-%20Cut%20Letters) | Medium
 \
 Given a String, cut 0 to count-1 letters from it.
 \
 Print return all permutations of the cuts, in alphabetically sorted order.
 
 [Count Palindromes](Strings**%20-%20Count%20Palindromes) | Medium
 \
 Count the number of possible palindrome substrings in a string.
 \
 i.e. "aaa" has 6 palindromes.
 
 ### Data Structures - Linked List
 [Reverse a Doubly Linked List](LinkedList*%20-%20Reverse%20a%20Doubly%20Linked%20List) | Easy | [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reverse-a-doubly-linked-list?h_r=internal-search)
 \
 Given the pointer to the head node of a doubly linked list, reverse the order of the nodes in the list.

 ### Data Structures - Tree
 [Count Longest Branch](Tree*%20-%20Count%20The%20Longest%20Branch) | Easy
 \
 Given a Node with left and right child nodes, count the longest branch in the tree.
 
 ### Sorting
 
 [BubbleSort](Sort*%20-%20BubbleSort) | Easy | [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/problem) | CTCI🌟
 \
 Sort an int array. Return the number of Swaps required to sort it.

 ### Dynamic Programming
 [Fibonacci Numbers](DP*%20-%20Fibonacci%20Numbers) | Easy |
 [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-fibonacci-numbers/problem)
 \
 Return the Fibonacci number at index n.
 \
 [Coin Change](DP***%20-%20Coin%20Change) | Hard | [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-coin-change/problem) |  CTCI🌟
 \
 Given a target dollars amount, and a list of dollar values for distinct coins, print the number of ways you can make change for n dollars if each coin is available in an infinite quantity.
