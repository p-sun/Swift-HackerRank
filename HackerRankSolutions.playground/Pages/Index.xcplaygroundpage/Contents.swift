 \
 Given an integer array, return the greatest SUM of any of the two numbers.
 
 [Merge Intervals](Array**%20-%20Merge%20Intervals) | Medium | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
 \
 Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
 
 [Add Interval]("Array***%20-%20Add%20Interval") | Hard
 \

 \
 Find the minimum number of character deletions required to make two strings anagrams of each other.
 i.e. Given "abc" and "uwbja", we need to delete 4 letters total so they'd become "ab" and "ba".
 
 ### Strings
 [Is Palindrome](Strings*%20-%20Is%20Palindrome) | Easy | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description)

 \
 Given a String, cut 0 to count-1 letters from it.
 \
 Print return all permutations of the cuts, in alphabetically sorted order.
 
 [Count Palindromes](Strings**%20-%20Count%20Palindromes) | Medium
 \
 Count the number of possible palindrome substrings in a string.
 \
 i.e. "aaa" has 6 palindromes.
