// Find the minimum number of character deletions required to make two strings anagrams of each other.
// i.e. Given "abc" and "uwbja", we need to delete 4 letters total so they'd become "ab" and "ba".
// It is guaranteed that a and b consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e. a through z).

import Foundation

// Method A. Time O(a + b)
